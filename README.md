# Tribe-image-classification
# 🧬 Tribe Image Classification using Deep Learning

## 📘 Overview  
This project builds a deep learning model to classify images of different tribes (or cultural groups) using convolutional neural networks (CNN). It aims to enable automatic identification of tribe/culture from images for applications in anthropology, heritage documentation, or cultural-recognition systems.

## 🎯 Objective  
To design an image classification pipeline that:  
- Handles image preprocessing and augmentation  
- Trains a CNN model to distinguish between multiple tribe/image classes  
- Evaluates and validates model performance  
- Demonstrates real-world value in cultural image recognition  

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
Python | NumPy | TensorFlow / Keras | OpenCV | Matplotlib | Jupyter Notebook

## 🧮 Approach  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Load images, resize, normalize, apply augmentation (rotations/flips)  
2. **Model Design** – Build a CNN architecture (or use transfer learning) tailored for fine-grained image classification  
3. **Training & Validation** – Split data train/val/test, train model with early stopping, monitor loss & accuracy  
4. **Evaluation** – Assess model with metrics: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report  
5. **Deployment / Prediction** – Demonstrate inference on sample images, maybe build a simple UI or script  

## 📈 Key Results  
- Model achieved **Accuracy** on the test set   
- Confusion matrix shows class-wise performance; misclassifications reduced by using augmentation and dropout  
- Real-world insight: Certain visual cues like traditional attire or background appear as strong class indicators
